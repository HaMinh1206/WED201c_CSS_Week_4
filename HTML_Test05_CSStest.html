            <h2> Keep fighting!</h2>
            <p>
                Life can get tough, but it’s
                important to keep fighting for
                the better times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember that life is about ups
                and downs. You only know what
                “down” feels like because you’ve
                previously experienced the “‘up.”
                The reason why you keep fighting
                when you’re down is so that you
                can experience the opposite
                once more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, don’t be afraid to reach
                out for help if you feel like you
                can’t keep fighting. We’d all like to
                think we’re capable and strong
                enough to get through
                everything, but the reality is that
                we all need a helping hand
                sometimes. It’s nothing to be
                ashamed of.

            <h2> Why do we care?</h2>
            <p>
                Care about what people think and
                you will always be their prisoner. -
                Lao Tzu
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s none of your business. What
                people think about you is their
                business and not yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                How many times have you looked at
                someone from a distance, judged
                them by their appearance, and then
                subsequently met them and
                changed your whole opinion? Many
                times, I am sure. You see, you never
                really get the full picture about
                someone, not really. So if someone
                forms an opinion about you without
                all the information and based on
                superficial things, then that’s their
                problem, not yours. Let them worry
                about it while you get on with your
                life knowing the full story.
